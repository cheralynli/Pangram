This program determines whether a sentence is a pangram or not, meaning a sentence which has all 26 letters of the alphabet. An example: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

This program taught me the use of ASCII characters to index letters from 0-25. It also taught me how to properly utilize arrays, such as using bool letters[26] = false.
